# helium
helium is a small and lightweight s3 storage proxy
## What is helium?
First of all: helium is not an image server. It is only the proxy used by the helium clients (coming soonâ„¢).
helium is a proxy for uploading and deleting files on storage servers (for example for use in your personal image server).
Of course you can work on your own implentation of the helium api
